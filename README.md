## 📌 About The Project

 <!-- Placeholder for a real screenshot -->

In an age of information overload, the ability to quickly distill text is paramount. The **AI Text Summarizer** is a modern, self-contained web application designed to address this need with a strong emphasis on **user privacy and control**.

Unlike other online summarizers that process your data on their servers, this tool operates entirely within your browser. It makes direct API calls to an external Large Language Model (LLM) endpoint that *you* provide. This ensures that your sensitive documents, research papers, or private communications are never stored, logged, or analyzed by a third party.

This project was built to demonstrate a powerful, serverless-first approach to AI tooling, combining a sleek user interface with robust functionality in a single, portable HTML file.

-   **🔌 Bring Your Own Endpoint (BYOE):** Fully compatible with services like **Ollama Cloud**, **Cloudflare Workers AI**, or any
